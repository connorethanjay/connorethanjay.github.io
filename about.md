<p> I found my passion when I was in High School where I was able to experience and eventually excel working with enterprise networking equipment. 
This experience is the one that changed my life for the better, when I was struggling with finding anything to look forward to. </p>

<p>I worked hard and my journey has continued on, getting my Cisco CCNA certification at a very young age. During this time I worked with my college as a Student Network Systems Engineer, being promoted to the Team Lead within my first year.

<p>Once I moved onto greater / more difficult industry topics, I joined Simpleroute as a Junior Solutions Engineer, and I am pursuing great things with their team.</p>

<p>I am incredibly passionate about the work I have been doing, it brings me joy to accomplish goals that I couldn't have imagined when I was in High School. 
I am currently working to achieve my Cisco CCNP Enterprise certification, which is my most difficult goal yet!</p>

# A little bit about me.

<p> I found my passion in High School where I was able to experience and eventually excel working with enterprise networking equipment. 
An experience that changed my life for the better, when I was struggling with finding anything to look forward to. </p>

<p>I worked hard and my journey has continued on, getting my Cisco CCNA certification at a very young age and continuing my studies while I work as a Junior Solutions Engineer with Simpleroute of Vermont.</p>

<p>I am incredibly passionate about the work I have been doing, it brings me joy to accomplish goals that I couldn't have imagined being close to years ago. 
I am currently working to achieve my Cisco CCNP Enterprise certification, which is my most difficult goal yet!</p>
